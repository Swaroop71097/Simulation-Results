Here, we can see the simulation for the for evolution of lumen. As explained in report in chapter 4, we can observe the lumen growth till the wall shear stress is less than 0.5 Pa. Nearly after 80 days as shown in Fig. 4.1 and 4.2 the wall shear stress values reaches in normal range and lumen growth ceases. This same can be seen in this file below:

As discussed in Chapter 5. The simulation result for the start section of the arch of Fig.5.18 can be found below:

The simulation result for the mid section of the arch of Fig.5.19 is shown below:
